# Role Responsibility Matrix (RACI)

This template helps clarify who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for key project activities. Use this matrix to prevent role overlap and ensure clear accountability.

## RACI Legend

- **R (Responsible)**: Person/role who performs the work to complete the task
- **A (Accountable)**: Person/role who is ultimately answerable for the completion and approval of the task (only one A per activity)
- **C (Consulted)**: People/roles whose opinions are sought; two-way communication
- **I (Informed)**: People/roles who are kept up-to-date on progress; one-way communication

## How to Use This Template

1. **Customize for Your Project**: Add, remove, or modify activities based on your project's specific needs
2. **Review with Team**: Walk through the matrix with all stakeholders to ensure agreement
3. **Resolve Conflicts**: If multiple people are marked as Accountable for one activity, clarify and consolidate
4. **Update Regularly**: Revisit the matrix during project phases or when roles change
5. **Reference in Meetings**: Use this as a decision-making tool when questions about ownership arise

## Best Practices

- **One Accountable per Activity**: Never have more than one "A" for any single activity
- **Balance Workload**: Ensure no single role is overwhelmed with "R" assignments
- **Limit Consulted**: Too many "C" assignments can slow down decision-making
- **Clear Communication**: Use "I" assignments to keep stakeholders informed without creating bottlenecks
- **Document Exceptions**: Note any deviations from standard assignments for specific projects
