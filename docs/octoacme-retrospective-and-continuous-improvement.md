# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
Facilitated by **PM** with full team participation:

- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Include insights from all roles (**Developers**, **QA Lead**, **Business Analyst**, **Release Coordinator**, etc.)

## Tracking Improvements
- **PM** adds action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
- **Change Manager** evaluates if process improvements require formal change requests

## Example Action Item Template

- Description:

## Continuous Improvement Culture
