## General Handoff Best Practices

1. **Schedule Handoff Meetings**: Don't rely on documentation alone—schedule formal handoff sessions
2. **Use Checklists**: Walk through this checklist during handoff meetings to ensure nothing is missed
3. **Document Decisions**: Record key decisions and rationale during handoff discussions
4. **Allow Overlap**: When possible, have a brief overlap period where both teams are available
5. **Confirm Understanding**: Ask receiving team to summarize their understanding of deliverables
6. **Maintain Accessibility**: Ensure handing-off team remains available for questions during transition
7. **Track Action Items**: Log and assign any open items discovered during handoff
8. **Get Formal Sign-off**: Obtain written confirmation that handoff is complete
