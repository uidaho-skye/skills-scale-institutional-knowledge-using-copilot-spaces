# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation. This README provides an overview of our project management methodology and links to comprehensive process guides.

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme's project management methodology is designed for clarity, rapid iteration, and stakeholder alignment across cross-functional teams. Our approach emphasizes customer-first delivery, iterative planning, clear ownership, and data-informed decisions.

### Core Principles
- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Ship small, testable increments to enable rapid feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Define explicit roles and responsibilities for accountability
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Foster an environment that encourages feedback and learning

### Project Lifecycle Phases

**1. Initiation**  
Projects begin with structured validation of business needs, definition of outcomes and key metrics, and documentation of stakeholder roles and communication plans. Initial deliverables include a project one-pager, stakeholder registry, estimated timeline, and risk list to ensure alignment before planning begins.

**2. Planning**  
Work is broken into shippable increments with prioritized backlog items, clear acceptance criteria, and scope estimation. A "Definition of Done" is established, and risks and dependencies are catalogued in a risk register for regular review.

**3. Execution & Tracking**  
Projects are tracked using boards with defined workflow stages (Backlog, Ready, In Progress, Review, QA, Done). Strict pull request protocols ensure small, well-documented changes undergo automated CI testing and peer review.

**4. Release & Deployment**  
Quality assurance is integrated throughout the lifecycle with unit, integration, and end-to-end smoke tests, plus manual QA when needed. Security scanning and risk management processes safeguard all deliverables.

**5. Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**  
Retrospectives are held after major milestones or incidents to capture lessons learned, prioritize actionable improvements, and measure their impact in subsequent cycles.

### Roles & Responsibilities

- **Project Managers**: Coordinate delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Managers**: Own product vision, backlog prioritization, and success metrics
- **Product Owners**: Translate vision into actionable sprint goals and user stories
- **Developers**: Implement features, maintain code quality, and collaborate in reviews
- **Business Analysts**: Bridge stakeholder needs and technical requirements
- **QA Lead**: Ensure quality standards through testing strategy and execution
- **Communications Coordinator**: Structure and manage all project communications
- **Change Managers**: Oversee change requests and assess project impact
- **Release Coordinators**: Plan and orchestrate releases across teams
- **Support/Operations Lead**: Ensure post-release operations and ongoing support
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, approvals, and strategic guidance

### Communication Cadence

- **Daily standups**: Team synchronization and blocker identification
- **Weekly syncs**: PM and Product Manager alignment
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**: Progress reports and strategic alignment
- **Escalation paths**: Team-level triage to sponsor-level intervention for critical issues

### Key Artifacts

- Project Charter / One-pager
- Stakeholder Registry
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items
- Role Responsibility Matrix (RACI)
- Phase Handoff Checklists

All process documents are maintained in this centralized repository to enable scalability, consistency, and serve as a single source of truth for onboarding and day-to-day execution.
