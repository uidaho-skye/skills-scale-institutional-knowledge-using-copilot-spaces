# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. **Kickoff meeting** with stakeholders and delivery team
   - **PM** facilitates, **PdM** presents vision, **Business Analyst** reviews requirements
2. **Create prioritized backlog** with acceptance criteria
   - **PdM** prioritizes, **Business Analyst** details requirements, **Developers** estimate
3. **Estimate scope** (T-shirt sizing or story points)
   - **Developers** provide technical estimates
4. **Define Definition of Done (DoD)**
   - **QA Lead** defines quality gates, team agrees on criteria
5. **Identify dependencies and integration points**
   - **PM** coordinates, **Business Analyst** documents cross-functional dependencies
6. **Create release plan and milestone map**
   - **Release Coordinator** (if assigned) or **PM** creates schedule
   - **Change Manager** reviews for change management touchpoints

## Sprint / Iteration Planning
- Timebox planning to agreed sprint length
- Pull items that meet DoD and have clear acceptance criteria
